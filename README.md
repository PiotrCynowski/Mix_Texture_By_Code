## Project: Texture Noise Mixer
Overview: The Texture Noise Mixer is a versatile tool for combining multiple textures into a single composite texture that resembles a noise-mixed pattern. 
This tool provides users with the flexibility to generate complex and visually appealing textures by controlling various parameters such as texture selection, height mapping, color blending, tiling, and edge transitions.

Key Features:

### Texture Mixing:
Combine multiple textures into one composite texture that blends them based on user-defined parameters.

### Height-Based Noise Mapping:
Use height maps to influence the noise pattern, determining how different textures are mixed.

### Color-Based Texture Generation:
Generate texture variants that focus on color blending.

### Tiling Options:
Apply individual tiling settings to each texture before mixing, providing control over how textures repeat across the final output.

### Edge Transition Control:
Choose between smooth and sharp edge transitions between textures.

### Two Generation Modes:
Single Large Texture: Generate one large composite texture based on the setup parameters.
Tile Generator: Create a tile matrix, then automatically generate and assign textures to each tile, representing a single large texture.
